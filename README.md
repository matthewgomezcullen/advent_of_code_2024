Hi there! Here are my solutions to Advent of Code 2024. Feel free to take a look.

I dump all my input files in an `inp` directory titled `day_one.txt`, `day_two.txt`, etc., 
then run these from the root directory with 

```python day_<n>/part_<one_or_two>.py```

For example,

```python day_1/part_1.py```

The `inp` directory is copied in the .gitignore file to not share my test data.

*Note, these solutions are by no means the most efficient or beautiful, they're simply how I solved them.*

Enjoy!
